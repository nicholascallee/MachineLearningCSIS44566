# Assignment 7
In this assignment you will take the data set that we used in the previous assignment and use SVM with different kernels to build and test a classifier.

## Introduction
Refer to the SVM slides.  Look at the note books in csis-machine-learning
1. svc_iris
2. svc_kernel
  

## What to do
Modify the Assignmenty note book by finishing the tasks listed in the code and mark down sections.
## Submission
### Process:  There are multiple parts to the assignment. Fill in the code and notes sections associated with each part.  You should not need to add in extra sections, but if you feel the need, do so.   
### Commit and Push
Anytime you complete a part, you are required to commit to your local personalized copy of the repository. You will then push to the github repository.  Use good commit messages.  _Points will be deducted if you don't commit for each part._  Note:  It is always acceptable to make a change to a section later. Just remember to commit and push your work.
